Windows Installation Guide for hdlConverter
--------------------------------------------
 *In order to install hdlConverter, either Visual Studio or another C++ compiler is required as well as CMake. *

* Additionally, due to the use of MSBuild in these examples, you'll want to have Visual Studio added to your path. An
example of how this can be done for Visual Studio 2019 is by adding
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Enterprise\MSBuild\Current\Bin" to your PATH in environment
variables. *

You can reference the .appveyor.yml file located at https://github.com/Nic30/hdlConvertor.git for installation
instructions as well as this document.

* In the following example, Visual Studio 16 2019 (-G "Visual Studio 16 2019") is used as the GENERATOR variable in CMake
while x64 (-A x64) is used as the ARCHITECTURE variable. These can both also be seen from the .appveyor.yml file. *

* %PYTHON%\\python.exe refers to the terminal command for Python 3 or the complete path to Python 3's executable *

To begin, you'll need to download https://www.antlr.org/download/antlr-4.9-complete.jar and rename it to
'antlr4-complete.jar'. After you've downloaded the jar file, clone the hdlConverter repository using
'git clone https://github.com/Nic30/hdlConvertor.git' Next, navigate to the root directory of the hdlConverter
repository that you've just cloned and run the following commands:
1.    pip3 install git+https://github.com/Nic30/hdlConvertorAst.git
2.    git clone https://github.com/antlr/antlr4
3.    cd antlr4/runtime/Cpp
4.    git checkout 4.9
5.    mkdir build
6.    cd build
7.    cmake -G"Visual Studio 16 2019" -A x64 -DWITH_STATIC_CRT=Off -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="C:\Program Files\LIBANTLR4" ..
8.    msbuild LIBANTLR4.sln /p:configuration=Release /p:platform=x64
9.    cmake -P cmake_install.cmake

Lastly, for installation, return to the root directory of the hdlConverter repo. This should be accessible via:
    cd ../../../../

Once you return to the root directory, run:
1.    %PYTHON%\\python.exe -m pip install jupyter git+https://github.com/Nic30/hdlConvertorAst.git
2.    %PYTHON%\\python.exe -m pip install -r requirements.txt

Finally, to build the library and remove the unnecessary files to reduce any conflicts with module imports, run the
following commands:
1.    %PYTHON%\\python.exe setup.py install -- -DJava_JAR_PATHS="C:\\The_Directory_Containing_The_JAR_File" -DANTLR4CPP_ROOT="C:\\Program Files\\LIBANTLR4" -G"Visual Studio 16 2019" -A x64
2.    rmdir /s /q hdlConvertor
